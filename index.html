            The Flexible Box Module, usually referred to as flexbox, was
            designed as a one-dimensional layout model, and as a method that
            could offer space distribution between items in an interface and
            powerful alignment capabilities. This article gives an outline of
            the main features of flexbox, which we will be exploring in more
            detail in the rest of these guides.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we describe flexbox as being one dimensional we are describing
            the fact that flexbox deals with layout in one dimension at a time —
            either as a row or as a column. This can be contrasted with the
            two-dimensional model of
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Grid_Layout"
              >CSS Grid Layout</a
            >, which controls columns and rows together.
          </p>
        </div>

        <section class="main-section" id="the_two_axes_of_flexbox">
          <h2 class="h2">The two axes of flexbox</h2>
          <p>
            When working with flexbox you need to think in terms of two axes —
            the main axis and the cross axis. The main axis is defined by the
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-direction"
              ><code>flex-direction</code></a
            >
            property, and the cross axis runs perpendicular to it. Everything we
            do with flexbox refers back to these axes, so it is worth
            understanding how they work from the outset.
          </p>
          <h3 id="main-ax">The main axis</h3>
          <p>
            The main axis is defined by <code>flex-direction</code>, which has
            four possible values:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>row</code></li>
            <li><code>row-reverse</code></li>
            <li><code>column</code></li>
            <li><code>column-reverse</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Should you choose <code>row</code> or <code>row-reverse</code>, your
            main axis will run along the row in the
            <strong>inline direction</strong>.
          </p>
          <h3 id="cross-ax">The cross axis</h3>
          <p>
            The cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis, therefore if
            your <code>flex-direction</code> (main axis) is set to
            <code>row</code> or <code>row-reverse</code> the cross axis runs
            down the columns.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="start_and_end_lines">
          <h2 class="h2">Start and end lines</h2>
          <p>
            Another vital area of understanding is how flexbox makes no
            assumption about the writing mode of the document. In the past, CSS
            was heavily weighted towards horizontal and left-to-right writing
            modes. Modern layout methods encompass the range of writing modes
            and so we no longer assume that a line of text will start at the top
            left of a document and run towards the right-hand side, with new
            lines appearing one under the other.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the <code>flex-direction</code> is <code>row</code> and I am
            working in English, then the start edge of the main axis will be on
            the left, the end edge on the right.
          </p>
          <p>
            If I were to work in Arabic, then the start edge of my main axis
            would be on the right and the end edge on the left.
          </p>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="the_flex_container">
          <h2 class="h2">The flex container</h2>
          <p>
            An area of a document laid out using flexbox is called a flex
            <strong>container</strong>. To create a flex container, we set the
            value of the area's container's
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/display"
              ><code>display</code></a
            >
            property to <code>flex</code> or <code>inline-flex</code>. As soon
            as we do this the direct children of that container become
            <strong>flex items</strong>. As with all properties in CSS, some
            initial values are defined, so when creating a flex container all of
            the contained flex items will behave in the following way.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Items display in a row (the <code>flex-direction</code> property's
              default is <code>row</code>).
            </li>
            <li>The items start from the start edge of the main axis.</li>
            <li>
              The items do not stretch on the main dimension, but can shrink.
            </li>
            <li>The items will stretch to fill the size of the cross axis.</li>
            <li>
              The
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-basis"
                >flex-basis</a
              >
              property is set to <code>auto</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
              The
              <a
                target="_blank"
                href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex-wrap"
                >flex-wrap</a
              >
              property is set to <code>nowrap</code>.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The result of this is that your items will all line up in a row,
            using the size of the content as their size in the main axis. If
            there are more items than can fit in the container, they will not
            wrap but will instead overflow. If some items are taller than
            others, all items will stretch along the cross axis to fill its full
            size.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can see in the live example below how this looks. Try editing
            the items or adding additional items in order to test the initial
            behavior of flexbox.

              ><code>flex-direction</code></a
            >
            property to the flex container allows us to change the direction in
            which our flex items display. Setting
            <code>flex-direction: row-reverse</code> will keep the items
            displaying along the row, however the start and end lines are
            switched.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we change <code>flex-direction</code> to <code>column</code> the
            main axis switches and our items now display in a column. Set
            <code>column-reverse</code> and the start and end lines are again
            switched.

        <section class="main-section" id="the_flex-wrap_property">
          <h2 class="h2">The flex-wrap property</h2>
          <p>
            While flexbox is a one dimensional model, it is possible to cause
            our flex items to wrap onto multiple lines. In doing so, you should
            consider each line as a new flex container. Any space distribution
            will happen across that line, without reference to the lines on
            either side.
          </p>
          <p>
            Should your items too large to all display in one line, they will
            wrap onto another line. The live sample below contains items that
            have been given a width, the total width of the items being too wide
            for the flex container. As <code>flex-wrap</code> is set to
            <code>wrap</code>, the items wrap. Set it to <code>nowrap</code>,
            which is also the initial value, and they will instead shrink to fit
            the container because they are using initial flexbox values that
            allows items to shrink. Using <code>nowrap</code> would cause an
            overflow if the items were not able to shrink, or could not shrink
            small enough to fit.

          />
          <p>
            Before we can make sense of these properties we need to consider the
            concept of <strong>available space</strong>. What we are doing when
            we change the value of these flex properties is to change the way
            that available space is distributed amongst our items. This concept
            of available space is also important when we come to look at
            aligning items.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we have three 100 pixel-wide items in a container which is 500
            pixels wide, then the space we need to lay out our items is 300
            pixels. This leaves 200 pixels of available space. If we don't
            change the initial values then flexbox will put that space after the
            last item.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we instead would like the items to grow and fill the space, then
            we need to have a method of distributing the leftover space between
            the items. This is what the <code>flex</code> properties that we
            apply to the items themselves, will do.
          </p>
          <h3 id="flex-basis">The <code>flex-basis</code> property</h3>
          <p>
            The flex-basis is what defines the size of that item in terms of the
            space it leaves as available space. The initial value of this
            property is <code>auto</code> — in this case the browser looks to
            see if the items have a size. In the example above, all of the items
            have a width of 100 pixels and so this is used as the
            <code>flex-basis</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the items don't have a size then the content's size is used as
            the flex-basis. This is why when we just declare
            <code>display: flex</code> on the parent to create flex items, the
            items all move into a row and take only as much space as they need
            to display their contents,
          </p>
          <h3 id="flex-grow">The flex-grow property</h3>
          <p>
            With the <code>flex-grow</code> property set to a positive integer,
            flex items can grow along the main axis from their
            <code>flex-basis</code>. This will cause the item to stretch and
            take up any available space on that axis, or a proportion of the
            available space if other items are allowed to grow too.
          </p>
          <p>
            If we gave all of our items in the example above a
            <code>flex-grow</code> value of 1 then the available space in the
            flex container would be equally shared between our items and they
            would stretch to fill the container on the main axis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The flex-grow property can be used to distribute space in
            proportion. If we give our first item a <code>flex-grow</code> value
            of 2, and the other items a value of 1 each, 2 parts of the
            available space will be given to the first item (100px out of 200px
            in the case of the example above), 1 part each the other two (50px
            each out of the 200px total).
          </p>
          <h3 id="flex-shrink">The flex-shrink property</h3>
          <p>
            Where the <code>flex-grow</code> property deals with adding space in
            the main axis, the <code>flex-shrink</code> property controls how it
            is taken away. If we do not have enough space in the container to
            lay out our items, and flex-shrink is set to a positive integer,
            then the item can become smaller than the <code>flex-basis</code>.
            As with <code>flex-grow</code>, different values can be assigned in
            order to cause one item to shrink faster than others — an item with
            a higher value set for <code>flex-shrink</code> will shrink faster
            than its siblings that have lower values.
          </p>
          <p>
            The minimum size of the item will be taken into account while
            working out the actual amount of shrinkage that will happen, which
            means that flex-shrink has the potential to appear less consistent
            than flex-grow in behavior. We'll therefore take a more detailed
            look at how this algorithm works in the article

            >.
          </p>
          <h3 id="flex-shorthand">Shorthand values for the flex properties</h3>
          <p>
            You will very rarely see the <code>flex-grow</code>,
            <code>flex-shrink</code>, and <code>flex-basis</code> properties
            used individually; instead they are combined into the
            <a
              target="_blank"
              href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/flex"
              >flex</a
            >
            shorthand. The flex shorthand allows you to set the three values in
            this order — <code>flex-grow</code>, <code>flex-shrink</code>,
            <code>flex-basis.</code>
          </p>
          <p>
            There are also some predefined shorthand values which cover most of
            the use cases. You will often see these used in tutorials, and in
            many cases these are all you will need to use. The predefined values
            are as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>flex: initial</code></li>
            <li><code>flex: auto</code></li>
            <li><code>flex: none</code></li>
            <li><code>flex: &#10092; positive-number &#10093;</code></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Setting <code>flex: initial</code> resets the item to the initial
            values of Flexbox. This is the same as
            <code> flex: 0 1 auto </code>. In this case the value of
            <code>flex-grow</code> is 0, so items will not grow larger than
            their <code>flex-basis</code> size. The value of
            <code>flex-shrink</code> is 1, so items can shrink if they need to
            rather than overflowing. The value of <code>flex-basis</code> is
            <code>auto</code>. Items will either use any size set on the item in
            the main dimension, or they will get their size from the content
            size.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using flex: auto is the same as using <code>flex: 1 1 auto</code>;
            everything is as with <code>flex:initial</code> but in this case the
            items can grow and fill the container as well as shrink if required.
          </p>
          <p>
            Using <code>flex: none</code> will create fully inflexible flex
            items. It is as if you wrote <code>flex: 0 0 auto</code>. The items
            cannot grow or shrink but will be laid out using flexbox with a
            <code>flex-basis</code> of <code>auto</code>.
          </p>
          <p>
            The shorthand you often see in tutorials is <code>flex: 1</code> or
            <code>flex: 2</code> and so on. This is as if you used
            <code>flex: 1 1 0</code> or <code>flex: 2 1 0</code> and so on,
            respectively. The items can grow and shrink from a
            <code>flex-basis</code> of 0.
          </p>

          <h2 class="h2">Managing free space between flex items</h2>
          <p>
            A key feature of flexbox is the ability to align and justify items
            on the main- and cross-axes, and to distribute space between flex
            items. Note that these properties are to be set on the flex
            container, not on the items themselves.
          </p>

              target="_blank"

              ><code>align-items</code></a
            >
            property will align the items on the cross axis.
          </p>
          <p>
            The initial value for this property is <code>stretch</code> and this
            is why flex items stretch to the height of the flex container by
            default. This might be dictated by the height of the tallest item in
            the container, or by a size set on the flex container itself.
          </p>
          <p>
            You could instead set <code>align-items</code> to
            <code>flex-start</code> in order to make the items line up at the
            start of the flex container, <code>flex-end</code> to align them to
            the end, or <code>center</code> to align them in the center. Try
            this in the live example — I have given the flex container a height
            in order that you can see how the items can be moved around inside
            the container. See what happens if you set the value of align-items
            to:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><code>stretch</code></li>
            <li><code>flex-start</code></li>
            <li><code>flex-end</code></li>
            <li><code>center</code></li>

              ><code>justify-content</code></a
            >
            property is used to align the items on the main axis, the direction
            in which <code>flex-direction</code> has set the flow. The initial
            value is <code>flex-start</code> which will line the items up at the
            start edge of the container, but you could also set the value to
            <code>flex-end</code> to line them up at the end, or
            <code>center</code> to line them up in the center.
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also use the value <code>space-between</code> to take all
            the spare space after the items have been laid out, and share it out
            evenly between the items so there will be an equal amount of space
            between each item. To cause an equal amount of space on the right
            and left of each item use the value <code>space-around</code>. With
            <code>space-around</code>, items have a half-size space on either
            end. Or, to cause items to have equal space around them use the
            value <code>space-evenly</code>. With <code>space-evenly</code>,
            items have a full-size space on either end.
